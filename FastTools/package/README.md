Reduced usage delay for build hammer and other placement tools. Delay is configurable. Stamina cost is also configurable.

Run the game once with the mod enabled to generate the config. See config for details on what each option does.

This mod is client only and does not need to be installed on dedicated servers. For the best experience, all clients should use the same configuration.

## Installation
This mod is designed to install and run via [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/). You can optionally install it manually following the steps below.

**Manual Install**
1. Install [BepInExPack Valheim](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/)
2. Download latest ``FastTools.dll`` by clicking "Manual Download". Extract the dll from the zip file into ``[GameDirectory]\Bepinex\plugins``. (You only need the dll.)
3. Run the game once, then close it and edit the generated cfg file in ``[GameDirectory]\Bepinex\config`` if you want to customize anything.
