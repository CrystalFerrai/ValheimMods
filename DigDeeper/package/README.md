Increased the depth you can dig into the ground by 150%. The amount is configurable.

Also allow you to configure the height you can raise terrain.

Run the game once with the mod enabled to generate the config. See config for details on what each option does.

This mod is client only and does not need to be installed on dedicated servers. However, all clients must run the same configuration to avoid terrain terraforming issues.
