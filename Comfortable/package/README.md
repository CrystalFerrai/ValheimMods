Adds configuration options to modify comfort item radius, fire warmth radius, rested buff base time and rested buff time per comfort level.

This mod changes nothing by default until you modify the mod config. Run the game once with the mod enabled to generate the config. See config for details on what each option does.

This mod is client only and does not need to be installed on dedicated servers. For the best experience, all clients should use the same configuration.

## Installation
